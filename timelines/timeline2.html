                The POW team continues to provide support to local families in need,
            offering emotional support as families juggle new challenges of home-schooling
            and even greater isolation. This team is also supporting families 
            to access food, basic need, and activity kits
            to engage in with their families. The team has nearly 75 interactions with families each week via 1:1 support
